## Environments

The Observability Platform has two environments:

- `development`

- `production`

The `development` environment is used for platform development and testing.

The `production` environment is where all the Observability Platform tenants are onboarded.

## Deployment

Observability Platform is deployed on the [Modernisation Platform](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/), and the source is available [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments/observability-platform).
