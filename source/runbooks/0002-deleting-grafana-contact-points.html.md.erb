Grafana's notification policy tree is dependent on contact points in Terraform, therefore you cannot delete a contact point until
it is removed from the notification policy tree.

To workaround this, a script has been created, which can be executed from [`modernisation-platform-environments`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments).

1. Launch `modernisation-platform-environments` [dev container](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/.devcontainer)

1. Change directory into `observability-platform`

    ```bash
    cd terraform/environments/observability-platform
    ```

1. Run the script

    ```bash
    bash contrib/delete-contact-point.sh ${stage} ${contact_point_name}
    ```

1. Remove the contact point from Observability Platform's Terraform [environment configuration](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/blob/main/terraform/environments/observability-platform/environment-configurations.tf).
