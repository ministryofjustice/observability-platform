We are unable to programatically rotate and consume a Grafana API key in Terraform, therefore we must rotate this externally.

To achieve this, we have created an [AWS Lambda function](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/observability-platform-grafana-api-key-rotator) to automatically recreate the key and upload it AWS Secrets Manager every 14 days.

Should this process fail, the following instructions can be used to rotate it manually:

1. Log in to the Grafana instance using the [AWS access portal](https://moj.awsapps.com/start#/).

1. Navigate to the "API Keys" section under "Administration".

1. Delete the expired API Key.

1. Generate a new API Key by clicking on the "Add API Key" button, and using the following details:
  > Key name: `observability-platform-automation`
  >
  > Key role: `Admin`
  >
  > Time to live: `1209600`

1. Copy the new API Key to your clipboard.

1. Login to the respective AWS environment, either `observability-platform-development` or `observability-platform-production`.

1. Open AWS Secrets Manager

1. Update `grafana/api-key` by selecting "Retrieve secret value"

1. Click "Edit"

1. Update the text with the new API Key.

1. Click "Save"

Repeat these steps for both `dev` and `alpha` environments.
