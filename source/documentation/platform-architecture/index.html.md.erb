At it's core, Observability Platform is [Amazon Managed Grafana](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/) (AMG), which offers a serverless (as in we don't have to run infrastructure for it) single pane of glass view of onboarded account's [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), and other SaaS services which offer an integration, such as GitHub or ServiceNow.

Additionally Observability Platform also offers:

- Integration with [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/).

- A central metric store, [Amazon Managed Prometheus](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/) (AMP).

- Alerting with PagerDuty and Slack.
